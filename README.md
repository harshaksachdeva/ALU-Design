# ALU-Design

# Abstract
Microprocessors are some of the most widely used components in circuits. They are present in laptops, desktops, mobiles, cars, and many more devices. Every microprocessor has an essential element called the ALU. The ALU performs the basic arithmetic and logical operations in a circuit. The aim of this project is to design and simulate a 8 bit ALU, using a hardware description language (Verilog). The ALU can perform 8-bit arithmatic operations like addition, subtraction and logic operations like AND, OR, XOR. Basically, it is a combinational circuit that takes 8-bit data as input and gives 8-bit output by performing specified arithmetic and logical operations.

# Designing the ALU
ALU is a combinational circuit taking two 8-bit data words A and B as the input, and producing a 8-bit output Y by performing the specified arithmetic or logical operation on the A and B inputs. The operation to be executed by the ALU is specified by a control input. The ALU also has a Z flag and an N flag as output. The Z flag signifies whether or not the output is zero. The N flag signifies whether or not the output is negative. The logical symbol of the ALU is shown below.

Inputs of an ALU are primarily the operands which are the data to be operated on. In addition, an ALU has opcodes (operation codes) as inputs to control the type of operation the ALU shall perform.
